Based on this fundamental result, we derive a parametrization of linear feedback systems that paves the way to solve important control problems using data-dependent linear matrix inequalities only. The result is remarkable in that no explicit system's matrices identification is required. The examples of control problems we solve include the state and output feedback stabilization, and the linear quadratic regulation problem. We also discuss robustness to noise-corrupted measurements and show how the approach can be used to stabilize unstable equilibria of nonlinear systems.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop non-parametric methods to estimate the L2-gain (H$\infty$-norm) of a linear dynamical system from iterative experiments. This work is mainly motivated by model error modeling, where the error dynamics are more complex than can be captured by a low order parametric model. The standard system identification approach to the gain estimation problem is to estimate a parametric model of the system, which is then used to calculate the gain. If it is possible to update the input signal during the experiment, an alternative way is to iteratively optimize the input signal in order to maximize the estimated input to output gain. A key observation is that the gradient of the gain with respect to the input signal can, without knowing a model, be found from two experiments. Iterative numerical methods for calculation of eigenvalues of matrices, e.g., the Power Method or the Lanczos Method, can then be applied to update the input signal sequence between experiments in order to find the maximum gain. The main difficulty compared to the corresponding eigenvalue problem in numerical analysis is the effects of additive measurement noise, which require modified schemes that avoid bias errors. Three such related methods are derived and evaluated by a numerical example. Partial results on convergence and statistical properties of the gain estimator are given. A constrained stochastic gradient method with local optimization of step-length gives the best numerical results in the case of noisy data.}

Therefore, we consider the problem of determining a dissipation inequality for an input-output system. In practice, yet, the core issue is that one would only know finitely many input-output samples while the input-output relationship would be undisclosed analytically. For such scenarios, we provide an approach for computing dissipation inequalities based upon knowledge of large amounts of input-output samples, as they arise in applications nowadays gathered under the term “big data”. Our approach will, under certain conditions, provide dissipation inequalities which remain satisfied for all input-output pairs that the system can produce, though only having been derived from finitely many of them.}

The gain is estimated using a bandpass filter at each sample frequency, and the filter parameter is optimized by maximizing the estimate of the $\ell$2 gain near the peak gain. This filtering method is extended to multivariable systems. Another method of making an optimal bandpass filter is derived from the iterative-experiment method. The filtering method is compared with other estimation methods in terms of noise sensitivity through a series of numerical experiments.}

abstract = {In data-driven control, a central question is how to handle noisy data. In this work, we consider the problem of designing a stabilizing controller for an unknown linear system using only a finite set of noisy data collected from the system. For this problem, many recent works have considered a disturbance model based on energy-type bounds. Here, we consider an alternative more natural model where the disturbance obeys instantaneous bounds. In this case, the existing approaches, which would convert instantaneous bounds into energy-type bounds, can be overly conservative. In contrast, without any conversion step, simple arguments based on the S-procedure lead to a very effective controller design through a convex program. Specifically, the feasible set of the latter design problem is always larger, and the set of system matrices consistent with data is always smaller and decreases significantly with the number of data points. These findings and some computational aspects are examined in a number of numerical examples.}

Both can be obtained by solving a linear matrix inequality for a fixed scalar parameter, and possibly iterating on different values of that parameter. The results of this data-based approach are compared with the ideal case when the model is known perfectly.}

abstract = {Due to their relevance in systems analysis and (robust) controller design, we consider the problem of determining control-theoretic system properties of an a priori unknown system from data only. More specifically, we introduce a necessary and sufficient condition for a discrete-time linear time-invariant system to satisfy a given integral quadratic constraint (IQC) over a finite time horizon using only one input–output trajectory of finite length. Furthermore, for certain classes of IQCs, we provide convex optimization problems in form of semidefinite programs (SDPs) to retrieve the optimal, i.e. the tightest, system property description that is satisfied by the unknown system. Finally, we provide bounds on the difference between finite and infinite horizon IQCs and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in a variety of simulation studies including noisy measurements and a high dimensional system.}

abstract = "In this paper new algorithms are developed for J-spectral factorization of polynomial matrices. These algorithms are based on the calculus of two-variable polynomial matrices and associated quadratic differential forms, and share the common feature that the problem is lifted from the original one-variable polynomial context to a two-variable polynomial context. The problem of polynomial J-spectral factorization is thus reduced to a problem of factoring a constant matrix obtained from the coefficient matrices of the polynomial matrix to be factored. In the second part of the paper, we specifically address the problem of computing polynomial J-spectral factors in the context of H-infinity control. For this, we propose an algorithm that uses the notion of a Pick matrix associated with a given two-variable polynomial matrix.",

In terms of electrical circuits, the systems that we study may be viewed as passive networks with ideal diodes. Extending results from earlier work, we consider here complementarity systems with external inputs. It is shown that the assumption of passivity of the underlying input/output dynamical system plays an important role in establishing existence and uniqueness of solutions. We prove that solutions may contain delta functions but no higher-order impulses. Several characterizations are provided for the state jumps that may occur due to inconsistent initialization or to input discontinuities. Many of the results still hold when the assumption of passivity is replaced by the assumption of “passifiability by pole shifting”. The paper ends with some remarks on stability.}

   abstract = {In this paper we develop non-parametric methods to estimate the L-2-gain (H-infinity-norm) of a linear dynamical system from iterative experiments. This work is mainly motivated by model error modeling, where the error dynamics are more complex than can be captured by a low order parametric model. The standard system identification approach to the gain estimation problem is to estimate a parametric model of the system, which is then used to calculate the gain. If it is possible to update the input signal during the experiment, an alternative way is to iteratively optimize the input signal in order to maximize the estimated input to output gain. A key observation is that the gradient of the gain with respect to the input signal can, without knowing a model, be found from two experiments. Iterative numerical methods for calculation of eigenvalues of matrices, e.g., the Power Method or the Lanczos Method, can then be applied to update the input signal sequence between experiments in order to find the maximum gain. The main difficulty compared to the corresponding eigenvalue problem in numerical analysis is the effects of additive measurement noise, which require modified schemes that avoid bias errors. Three such related methods are derived and evaluated by a numerical example. Partial results on convergence and statistical properties of the gain estimator are given. A constrained stochastic gradient method with local optimization of step-length gives the best numerical results in the case of noisy data. },

Although successful implementations have been reported, a solid analysis with respect to the convergence of these iterations has not been established. The aim of this paper is to present a thorough analysis of a specific iterative algorithm that involves nonparametric H$\infty$-norm estimation. The pursued methodology involves a novel frequency domain approach that addresses both additive stochastic disturbances and input normalization. The results of the convergence analysis are twofold: (1) the presence of additive disturbances introduces a bias in the estimation procedure, and (2) the iterative procedure can be interpreted as experiment design for H$\infty$-norm estimation, revealing the value of iterations and limits of accuracy in terms of the Fisher information matrix. The results are confirmed by means of a simulation example.}

abstract = {Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems.
    However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken.
    We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator.
    This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series.
    We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively.
    We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples.
    Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework.
    In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory.
    It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science.
    We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.}

abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.}}

 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},
