# Notes:

1. Dummy texts are added using lipsum package.
2. You can use the chapter template to add more intermediate chapters.
3. You can ignore the \underbar or \underline warnings unless you plan to use underlines in your chapter titles. Ideally, you should not get any other warnings due to the template itself.
