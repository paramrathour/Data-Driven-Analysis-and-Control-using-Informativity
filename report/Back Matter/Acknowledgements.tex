I thank my parents for always motivating me. I would also like to express gratitude to my guide: Prof. Debasattam for introducing me to this fascinating topic. Most of the content here is inspired by \cite{vanwaarde2023informativity, 9781279, 9551767, 10383531, brunton2021modern}, many statements are directly taken from here and my explanations are based on my understanding from these papers. And, lastly thanks to you, reader, I have worked hard in making this thesis, in the hope that this work helps you in some way.
